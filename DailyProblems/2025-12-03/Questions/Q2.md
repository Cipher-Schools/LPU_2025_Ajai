### **Problem Statement**

You are climbing a staircase with `n` steps.

You can climb  **1 or 2 steps at a time** .

Return the **number of distinct ways** to reach the top.

### **Hint**

* Same recursion pattern as Fibonacci
* Recurrence: `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`
* Base cases: `n == 0` → 1, `n == 1` → 1
* Use recursion first, optimization later.
