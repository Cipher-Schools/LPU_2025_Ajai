[https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### **Problem Statement**

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list **using recursion** and return the new head.

### **Hint**

* Think: reverse the rest of the list → then fix one pointer.
* Recurrence idea:

  `newHead = reverse(head->next)`
* Then:

  `head->next->next = head`

  `head->next = NULL`
* Base case: when `head == NULL` or `head->next == NULL`.
